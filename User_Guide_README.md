# 📝 TODO Application Tutorial

Welcome to the **ABP** (Asp.Net Boilerplate) TODO Application tutorial! 🚀 This guide will walk you through building a simple TODO application using ABP. It's a quick-start tutorial designed to help you get familiar with ABP and see how it works in action.

---

## 🏗️ Select Your Solution Architecture

This tutorial provides two solution architectures. Choose the one that best fits your project:

### 🔹 Single-Layer Solution

This solution creates a **single-project** application. It’s perfect for small-scale applications and offers a **simpler** and **easy-to-understand** architecture. If you’re just getting started or building a small project, this is a great choice! 🧑‍💻

#### ✅ Recommended For:
- Small-scale applications
- Beginners
- Quick prototypes

---

### 🔸 Layered Solution

The **layered solution** uses a multi-project setup based on **Domain Driven Design (DDD)** principles. This architecture is ideal for larger, more complex applications that need to scale and remain **maintainable** over time. If you're working on a long-term project or a larger codebase, this is the way to go! 🛠️

#### ✅ Recommended For:
- Large-scale, complex applications
- Long-term projects
- Scalable and maintainable codebases
